The drawback with this method is if you have to deliver to say, 10 buyers from different locations within your city, it really becomes hectic.If you are based in a city like Lagos, when you factor in the cost of transportation and stress with traffic.It gets worse if you offer pay on delivery and the buyer decides not to buy on your arrival or is not available, the whole thing becomes a nightmare. If you want to make inter-state delivery, you could go to a bus park, find a driver going to the state of your buyer, negotiate a fee, andexchange phone numbers with the driver as well as driver and buyer.Next, hope the product gets to its destination safely and the buyer shows up on-time for pickup (probably Bus Park). I don’t think most buyers would like to go through such stress to buy a product.With this system, you certainly can’t have a ‘pay on delivery’ payment option, which is important for e-commerce sales in this part of the world.These are the logistic nightmares allot of small business owners in Nigeria selling online have to go through. I did some digging and found some companies with a good reputation here in Nigeria that actually makes these deliveries for you.I mean it is as simple as taking your product to their pickup point or request for pickup at your location and they deliver the product at your customer’s doorstep.You say ‘price?’ No fret, these companies have you, a small business owner in mind when putting up the services. 1. ACEACE is one of the popular delivery service company in Nigeria. ACE delivers all goods as small a lipstick too as large as a refrigerator.Their service has the small business owner in mind. Their process looks great. It’s quite easy and seem reliable. They pick the goods up from your place or you drop it off at any of ACE centre nearby to get it delivered. DELIVERY TIMEAs for delivery time, within Lagos, your goods get delivered the same day or the next working day. PRICEFor the price. ACE claims to offer the most affordable rates out there. You’ll have to contact them to know how affordable. PAY ON DELIVERYYes. ACE offers both cash on delivery and point-of-sale-payment (POS) option. For enquiries: info@ace.ng 2. COURIER PLUSCourier plus handles all sizes of deliveries. They deliver the parcel as small as a smartphone to one as big as a truck.They also handle international deliveries within Africa.However, the categories of their services listed on their site don’t seem to prioritize deliveries for e-commerce/small businesses compared to others on this list. DELIVERY TIMEDelivers in less than 24hrs within major cities in Nigeria. PAY ON DELIVERYNO 3. MAXHow MAX works are that you set your pickup location and delivery location. Next you move on to checkout, by which you would get the cost of your delivery.When a delivery request is made, a code is generated that is sent to the receiver. The code is requested by the max agent delivering the parcel before it handed over. The customer can pass the code to someone else to receive on his/her behalf if not present at the time of delivery.Seems pretty straightforward to me.At the time of writing this post, max makes deliveries within Lagos alone. DELIVERY TIMESame day deliveries take 5hrs. PAY ON DELIVERY:NO PS: you can get a delivery cost estimate from an in-site widget0700MAXDOTNG(070062936864)info@max.ngsuccess@max 4. NATION DELIVERY What I like about nation delivery is that, because they handle deliveries of various sizes, it offers room for scalability for small businesses. They have various logistics packages that you’ll have to check out to see which is best for you in terms of delivery time and cost.• Rush Delivery (20 -30mins)• Regular Delivery (1 -2hrs)• Express 12noon (delivers before noon of a business day)• Express 24 (deliveries before the close of business working day)• Express 48 (deliveries within 2 working days). They offer a 100% refund on delivery cost if the parcel doesn’t get to the destination on the stipulated time.If you are thinking of price, you can get a free quote from their site. You fill in the pickup location, destination, weight of parcel and dimensions. Play around with it to get an idea of how much you’ll be spending.They claim to have the most competitive price in the business with their Express AM delivery (70% cheaper) Overall, Nation Delivery seems to offer a robust delivery service. However, the downside with their service for e-commerce is that deliveries are mostly within Lagos. DELIVERY TIME: Depends on your preference. From within 30mins to 2days PAY ON DELIVERY:NO 5. GIG LOGISTICSGIG Logistics is one of the best indigenous delivery service company in Nigeria in my opinion.Not just because of their wide coverage across the country, also because they have robust logistics packages that fit most delivery needs. What I like about them are their e-commerce logistics solutions.There is;• SAME DAY DELIVERY• NEXT DAY DELIVERY• CASH ON DELIVERY• REVERSE LOGISTICS (parcel not picked up by customer)• REMOTE LOCATION DELIVERY• And HOLD FOR COLLECTION SERVICE (parcel are delivered to a pickup centre for your customer to pick up). Seems like everything in one place.As for price, they claim to offer unbeatable prices. You’ll have to fill a form to request for a quote. DELIVERY TIME:Same day to next day PAY ON DELIVERY:YES 6 RED STARRedstar is a logistics company in Nigeria that has been around for a while.They have the reputation to make them trusted.

DELIVERY TIME1 - 6 hrs within Lagos. Across states, it depends PAY ON DELIVERYYES FINAL THOUGHTSSo there you have it, my list of 6 companies that offer delivery service for small businesses in Nigeria 2019. This list is in no way exhaustive. There are the ubers for delivery like Delivery Bros and the international big players like UPS, FedExAnd DHL, etc. To decide on a delivery service you want to consider how fast they are with pick up and delivery, real-timeTracking and payment options. Will you have to pay, like a month ahead or do you pay per delivery? How about inter-state deliveries, how fast are they with it. So make the call or email and get necessary background information before you opt-in.If I left anything out or company that does well with e-commerce deliveries, please include them on the comment section.","categories":[{"name":"Logistics","slug":"Logistics","permalink":"https://nsg.com.ng/categories/Logistics/"}],"tags":[{"name":"business","slug":"business","permalink":"https://nsg.com.ng/tags/business/"},{"name":"delivery","slug":"delivery","permalink":"https://nsg.com.ng/tags/delivery/"},{"name":"e-commerce","slug":"e-commerce","permalink":"https://nsg.com.ng/tags/e-commerce/"},{"name":"SME","slug":"SME","permalink":"https://nsg.com.ng/tags/SME/"}],"author":"Lucky Uhuns"},{"title":"5 Reasons You Should Register Your Business Name With CAC in 2019","slug":"5-Reasons-you-should-Register-Your-Business-Name-with-CAC-in-2019","date":"2019-04-21T23:12:55.000Z","updated":"2019-04-21T23:40:24.631Z","comments":true,"path":"2019/04/22/5-Reasons-you-should-Register-Your-Business-Name-with-CAC-in-2019/","link":"","permalink":"https://nsg.com.ng/2019/04/22/5-Reasons-you-should-Register-Your-Business-Name-with-CAC-in-2019/","excerpt":"","text":"When starting a small business, you put a lot of things into consideration. Things like renting a store, purchasing raw materials, maybe acquiring labour and probably how to market the final product or service. However, one important consideration every startup has is cost.You want to reduce cost and get that amazing business idea off the ground and running. Because of that, many small businesses starting out don’t really see the importance of registering a business name with the Corporate Affairs Commission(CAC).The common perception is that the money could be used to grow the business further. from this article you will learn that registering your business name has several benefits that will actually grow your business more compared to not registering. ###Owning a Corporate Account with Banks in NigeriaSimply put, without having a registered business name, you cant open a cooperate account with any bank in Nigeria. Except you have no intention of making that small business a big business someday, then you might not need a cooperate account. You don’t want to be doing business transactions with your personal savings account. It makes you and in extension, your business look unprofessional. Business partnership thrives on trust. That trust can be built by the level of professionality (packaging) your business show. In a nutshell, you don’t want to lose potential business partnerships by looking shabby because you don’t have a cooperate account. ###Access to LoansAs an entrepreneur looking to start a business, your options for raising capital might be limited to securing a loan from a bank or other cooperate lending body. Or maybe you already have an established business and you want to scale up, your best option for raising fund would probably be securing a loan. Well, Most lending companies and organizations (if not all) in Nigeria will decline giving out loan to a startup whose business name is not duly registered with Cooperate Affairs Commission (CAC). ###Access to Grantsgrant is money given to given by an individual, government or organization to fund some course. Grants are great startup capital because unlike loans which you have to pay back plus interest, grants are free. Awesome right?. Grants are, however, highly competitive. Everyone wants to win it. To win a grant, like the one given by Tony Elumelu Foundation for startups in Africa, your business has to be registered. The reason for that is because, well, whoever is giving you that grant is not giving money for a vacation to Dubai. You getting the money to grow a business and to that person or organization, you’re not serious enough about that business if you can’t do as little as getting your business name registered with the appropriate body. ###Eligibility for Government Interventionsif you are familiar with the Bank of Industry (BOI) or Bank of Agriculture (BOA), these are government interventions setup as a source of credit to small and established businesses that want to scale up production or services. Acquiring credit from agencies like BOI and BOA is also competitive because interest rates are lower compared to loans offered by banks and payment duration is spread out over a favourable period for businesses. In other to benefit from these interventions, your business name must be registered. ##It Cost only 10,000nairaIf you’re still contemplating whether registering your business name should be a priority at the moment, here is one reason that might turn your head a little, it cost only 10,000naira plus 500naira for name reservation. This might turn out to be a bargain on the long-term if the price is increased subsequently.Watch this space for information on price change for registering a business name with cooperate affairs commission.

Without wasting time let’s get on about it. ###STEP 1To register a business name, first you want search for availability of the name. Just like registering a domain name for your website, you have to check if it’s not already taken.Head over to cac.gov.ngInput your proposed business name in the input box, check the reCAPCHA to show you’re not a robot then click search. From the above image above image you can see several Hakuna Matata registered names.

In Nigeria, not only is it the most used messenger app, it is the most used social media app in Nigeria according to Hootsuite’s The Global State of Digital in 2019 report. According to the report, Nigeria has 98.39million internet users with 24million users having an active social media account.WhatsApp is the most active social media platform in the country with 85% (20.4 million) of users. The second is Facebook at 78%, Instagram is third at 57%, followed by Facebook Messenger at 54% and Youtube at 53%. What does this mean for a small business owner in Nigeria? It means the majority of your customers and potential customers that have access to the internet are actively on WhatsApp. That is where you actively should be doing business as well. Outline Introduction to WhatsApp business App Features and how they can help small businesses• Business Profile• Quick Replies• Away Message• Greeting Message• Labels• Account Verification Final thoughts Whatsapp Business In 2018 WhatsApp launched the WhatsApp business app. The goal was to have a separate app dedicated to business interactions. Prior to the launch of whatsApp Business, people had already been using WhatsApp messenger to connect with customers. It, however, has some limitations for business. For instance, on the WhatsApp messenger, you don’t have fields to fill in business information like address, email and website or automating interactions with customers. These are necessary when you’re having a growing customer base. WhatsApp launched the WhatsApp business to address those limitations. According to the WhatsApp official website, WhatsApp business is free to download and was built with the small business owner in mind.With the app, businesses can interact with customers seamlessly by using tools to automate, sort and quickly respond to messages. With the WhatsApp business app, you can still do all the regular things you do with WhatsApp messenger. however, you cant use WhatsApp messenger and WhatsApp business on the same phone number. It has to be different phone numbers. Features of WhatsApp businessBusiness ProfileWith WhatsApp business, you can add more information about your business, compared to WhatsApp messenger. Information like the physical address of your business, google map, the category of your business, opening times and an about section where you can write a little about your business This is like a mini webpage for your customers on WhatsApp. Quick RepliesWhatsapp quick reply feature helps you reply to common questions from your customers with little hassle. How it works is that you save replies to common questions and reuse them whenever the same questions are asked. This feature is incredibly helpful in a lot of ways. Let’s assume you sell barbequed fish (yummy!), and you have 10 customers asking you what your payment options are. Your ideal reply might be “we accept cash or bank transfers to xxx account number, account name: john doe, Bank: Hakuna Matata bank” Replying that line to 10 customers is a whole lot of work. With the quick reply feature, all you need to do is save the line “we accept cash or bank transfers to xxx account number, account name: john doe, Bank: Hakuna Matata bank” with a keyword like ‘payment’. So whenever a client ask what your payment options are, all you do is type “/payment”, you will see your saved reply pop up on a scrolling window. When you tap a key word, your reply gets sent. Additionally, when you type ‘/’ all your quick replies show up.To add a quick reply, go to settings – business settings - quick replies, then add your quick replies Automated Away message the key to successfully using social media for business is engagement. Whatsapp Away Message feature lets you do just that even when you are offline or busy. To use the away message feature, you set a customized away message which gets sent automatically to customers whenever they send a message. To add automated away message, Go to Settings – Business settings – Away message (Under messaging tools) Automated Greeting MessageThe Greeting Message feature functions in a similar way to the away message as they are both triggered automatically when a customer sends a message. Just like the name implies, it is meant to greet a customer the moment they send a message. Think about it, when you go to a physical store to do whatever people do in stores. You know you feel important and excited to do business when you are welcomed with warm greetings.You can customize messages like: “Hey there, I am Jon Snow. Welcome to Westeros fashion, how can we be of service to you”. When enabled, your customers get that reply when they send a message. Greeting Message will automatically send another Greeting Message to a customer that has not replied after 14days.To enable greeting message Goto SETTINGS –BUSINESS SETTINGS – GREETING MESSAGE then change the default greeting message to your own. LabelsLabels on WhatsApp business basically lets you organize your customers chat into groups. For example, if you have a bunch of customers that are yet to make payments for your product, you can add a label like “Yet to Pay” to all of them. The same thing with labels for “New Customers (included by default), Order Complete or One Word Replies”. This feature is quite handy because it helps you organize your business contacts and keep track of your engagement with your customers. Verified WhatsApp business numberThese days of spam contents, internet fraud, and other illicit activities going on online. Just like on Facebook and Instagram, a verified WhatsApp business account helps people know that you are who you say you are. It helps people interacting with your business know you are the legit owner. A verified WhatsApp business account has the green tick like the one in the image above.Before your account can be verified, you have to meet certain requirements listed on the WhatsApp official website. If you meet those requirements, then verifying your account is just a few steps away Enter your phone number:o Choose your country from the drop-down list. This will automatically fill in your country code in the box on the left.o Enter your phone number in the box on the right. Don’t put a 0 before your phone number. Tap Next to receive a verification code. If prompted, you can also tap Call me to receive the code via phone call. Enter the 6-digit verification code you receive via SMS or phone call.Voila!!! Your account is Verified. Final ThoughtsWhatsapp business is a great tool every small business in Nigeria should have because it makes it easier to connect with customers. according to statistics, a lot of people use WhatsApp in this part of the world. bringing your business closer to your customers is always going to be a plus. The features the app comes with can help small businesses manage customer service relation (which is a crucial part of every business) with little effort.What aspect(s) of your business do you use WhatsApp for? drop your comment on the comment section.","categories":[{"name":"Digital Marketing","slug":"Digital-Marketing","permalink":"https://nsg.com.ng/categories/Digital-Marketing/"},{"name":"Social Media","slug":"Digital-Marketing/Social-Media","permalink":"https://nsg.com.ng/categories/Digital-Marketing/Social-Media/"}],"tags":[{"name":"WhatsApp","slug":"WhatsApp","permalink":"https://nsg.com.ng/tags/WhatsApp/"},{"name":"Social Media","slug":"Social-Media","permalink":"https://nsg.com.ng/tags/Social-Media/"},{"name":"Messaging","slug":"Messaging","permalink":"https://nsg.com.ng/tags/Messaging/"},{"name":"Business","slug":"Business","permalink":"https://nsg.com.ng/tags/Business/"},{"name":"Money","slug":"Money","permalink":"https://nsg.com.ng/tags/Money/"}]},{"title":"How to Use Social Media to Increase Your Sales","slug":"How-to-use-social-media-to-increase-your-sales","date":"2019-04-11T20:01:23.000Z","updated":"2019-04-11T21:59:25.643Z","comments":true,"path":"2019/04/11/How-to-use-social-media-to-increase-your-sales/","link":"","permalink":"https://nsg.com.ng/2019/04/11/How-to-use-social-media-to-increase-your-sales/","excerpt":"","text":"What actually is social sellingSocial selling is basically finding prospective customers and engaging them with relevant content. It is a long term process which involves building relationships, as opposed to traditional selling. Traditional selling is a fast, straight forward approach which is all about making short term sales. The problem is that, allot of small businesses trying to sell online use same old traditional techniques. What the stats sayAs of 2019, it is estimated that there is around 2.77 billion social Media users on the planet.That number is expected to rise to 3.02 billion by 2021.Obviously this is a goldmine for a business owner. This is where you want to be marketing your products. Identify where your prospective customers areThere are allot of social media platforms out there. It is certainly unrealistic to be active on every one of them. You need to identify which platform(s) your prospective customers would be. Because each social media platform is different in the way we use them, In other to know where your prospective buyers are, you should have mental picture of who your ideal buyer is. This is your buyer persona.You have to know what their goals are, what demographic they belong to. To better illustrate, let’s assume you sell female beauty products like makeup kits.Your buyer persona might be 18 – 25 year old female student or 27 – 35 year old working class female.Their goals might be to look good for the next faculty dinner party and for work on Monday respectively. You would expect to find these group on social media platform like Instagram.That is because they are most likely to share their good looks on a picture based social media platform. That is where you want to be marketing your makeup kits.The same applies for other social media platforms. Social selling gone wrongLet’s consider the Instagram post below. It is a post from a foot wear seller. The post contains a single image of the hair extension or a college of different hair extensions with a caption that reads “slippers with class, 11k, send a DM (direct message)”. All other posts from this seller are similar to this.While this might not entirely be an ineffective approach, the seller might have problems making long-term customers. Aside the image of pair of slipper, the only message I see there is a seller who just wants to sell products and who cares not for my interest. You need to understand that buying, whether physical product or service, is an emotional act. We buy from people we like, and people we like are people we who have our best interest at heart. In other words we buy from people who makes it known to us that they want us to get the best of what they are offering. Let’s consider a hypothetical scenario where you slept and had one those dreams that comes with several episodes in one night (I have that allot). On the first episode, you went to a retail store along the street to purchase a headphone. You ask the store guy to recommend a high quality one for you. He was like, “buy xxx headphone, its 10,000naira, people have been purchasing it all morning, buy now before it runs out of stock”. Next the universe switches you to the next episode. You find yourself walking to another headphone retail store across the street. On getting inside, you meet a polite store guy. You ask him for a headphone recommendation.He brought out xxx headphone and he was like, “you look like someone who workout regularly. If you do or you plan on doing so someday, this is the perfect headphone for you. It doesn’t slip and it has a tight grip. There are some that are way cheaper than this, however they don’t have the surround sound feature as this. You know that by the Dolby logo inscribed close to the speakers”. If you were to make a choice on whom to patronise between both stores, which will it be?Personally I would go with the second store. Why?The store guy wasn’t just interested in selling a product to me. He cared for my interest. He wanted me to get the best product. He educated me on the product. He even gave me ideas on things I could do with the headphone (workout). At this point, I see him as an industry expert in headphones. I trust that guy. i bet i’ll come a second time. DON’T JUST TRY TO SELL, ENGAGE WITH RELEVANT CONTENT Some of the mistakes I see allot of small businesses trying to sell online do in this part of the world (Nigeria) are:The assumption every potential buyero Is knowledgeable about the product.o Knows the product actually exists.o Knows the product will solve their problemso Know they actually have a problem to be solved With those assumptions, you will only be selling to a few at the end of their buyer’s journey.Accenture’s study, state of B2B procurement study, finds that, before making a purchase, 94% of B2B (business to business) buyers make some degree of research online. 55% of those buyers conducts research for at least half of their purchase.The goal here is to provide the information when they make that research which will build your reputation as an expert in your industry.this will ultimately drive sales up. Don’t post images of products and their prices, create content that educate your buyers about that product or service. Video review of a product Pros and cons of a product How to best use a product How to best care for a product Complementary products How a product is made How to spot fakeThe secret is identifying the needs of your potential customers and helping them with those needs. The core of your marketing strategy should be about them.
